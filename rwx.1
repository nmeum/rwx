.Sh NAME
.Nm rwx
.Nd run a command while X is running
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rwx
.Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens a connection to the current Xorg
.Ev DISPLAY
and keeps it open, afterwards it invokes the specified
.Ar command
thereby binding it to the lifetime of a specific display/server.
If the server does a reset before the command terminates the command
receives a SIGHUP.
.Pp
The main purpose of
.Nm
is invoking commands from your
.Pa .xsession
or
.Pa .xinitrc
startup file and making sure that these commands terminate when your X
server does.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width DISPLAY
.It Ev DISPLAY
.br
Name of the X display to connect to.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
If the specfied
.Ar command
terminates before the X server,
.Nm
exits with the exit status of the spawned command.
If the X server does a reset before the command completes
.Nm
exits with the exit status zero.
.Pp
If an error occurs, e.g. if
.Nm
couldn't open a connection to the current
.Ev DISPLAY
or if the given
.Ar command
couldn't be invoked
.Nm
exits with a non-zero exit status.
.Sh EXAMPLES
An example for a program that is usally invoked by the startup files
mentioned above is
.Xr redshift 1
to start it using
.Nm
you would add the following to your startup file:
.Pp
.Dl rwx redshift -l 23.42:13.37 >/dev/null &
